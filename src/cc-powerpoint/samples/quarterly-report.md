# Architecture Overview

```python
class PipelineOrchestrator:
    """Central pipeline for data processing."""

    def __init__(self, config: Config):
        self.stages = []
        self.config = config

    def add_stage(self, stage: Stage):
        self.stages.append(stage)

    def execute(self):
        for stage in self.stages:
            stage.run(self.config)
```

> This is the core pipeline pattern used across all our tools.
